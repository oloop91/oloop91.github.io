This site is about Arc, a new dialect of Lisp.  
<p>
Arc is designed for exploratory programming: the kind
where you decide what to write by writing it.  A good
medium for exploratory programming is one that makes programs
brief and malleable, so that's what we've aimed for.  This 
is a medium for sketching software.
</p><p>
Arc is unfinished. It's missing things you'd need to solve
some types of problems.  But it works well for 
<a href="http://news.ycombinator.com"><u>basic web apps</u></a>.
</p><p>
The first priority right now is the
<a href="http://paulgraham.com/core.html"><u>core language</u></a>.
We're trying to continue McCarthy's axiomatic approach all the
way up to a complete language for day to day programming.  
</p><p>
To the extent we can influence whatever customs are associated
with Arc, we'd like to propose three principles.
</p><p>
Number one, expect change.  Arc is still fluid and 
future releases are guaranteed to break all your code.
It was mainly to aid the evolution of the language
that we even released it.  
</p><p>
Second, we'd like to encourage a sense of community among Arc
users.  If you have a question or a suggestion, share it with
everyone in the 
<a href="forum"><u>forum</u></a>.   
And if you know the answer to a 
question you see in the forum, help out whoever posted it
by replying.  
</p><p>
And finally: It's not a coincidence that we wrote a language
for exploratory programming rather than the sort where an army
of programmers builds a big, bureaucratic piece of software
for a big, bureaucratic organization.  Exploratory programming is the
fun end of programming, and we hope that will be the guiding 
principle of the Arc community.
